abstract: >-
  Graph databases are used across several domains due to the
  intuitive structure of graphs. Yet, querying such graphs
  requires database expertsâ€™ involvement, reducing
  accessibility to non-experts. To address this issue, we
  present GraphDetective, a web interface that provides an
  intuitive entry point for graph data exploration, where
  users can create queries visually with little effort,
  eliminating the need for expertise in query writing. After
  processing, the resulting query output (a graph) is then
  rendered in an interactive 3D visualization for an easy
  interpretation. Our user evaluation revealed that even
  individuals inexperienced with graph databases or graph
  data in general could satisfactorily access the graph data
  through our interface. Furthermore, experienced
  participants commented that they found our interface to be
  more efficient to use compared to writing explicit queries
  in a graph database query language.
